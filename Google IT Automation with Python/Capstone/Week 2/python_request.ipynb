    "## The Python Requests Library\n",
    "Up to now, we've seen how we can serialize the data that we have in our programs and turn it into a format that we can store on disk. Once the data is stored, another process can open up those files, de-serialize them, and go from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works, but only if the other process has access to the same filesystem you used to store your data. What if you wanted to send a message to another computer on another network? HTTP to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that `HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` is the protocol of the world-wide web. When you visit a webpage with your web browser, the browser is making a series of HTTP requests to web servers somewhere out on the Internet. Those servers will answer with HTTP responses. This is also how we’re going to send and receive messages with web applications from our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) makes it super easy to write programs that send and receive HTTP. Instead of having to understand the HTTP protocol in great detail, you can just make very simple HTTP connections using Python objects, and then send and receive messages using the methods of those objects. Let's look at an example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> import requests\n",
    ">>> response = requests.get('https://www.google.com')\n",
    "```\n",
    "That's it! That was a basic request for a web page! We used the Requests library to make a HTTP GET request for a specific URL, or Uniform Resource Locator. The URL tells the Requests library the name of the resource (www.google.com) and what protocol to use to get the resource (https://). The result we get is an object of type [requests.Response](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, now what did the web server respond with? Let's take a look at the first 300 characters of the [Response.text](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response.text):  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print(response.text[:300])\n",
    "<!doctype html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPage\" lang=\"de\"><head><meta content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"><meta content=\"/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_128dp.png\" itemprop=\"image\"><title>Google</title><script nonce=\"dZfbIAn803LDGXS9\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, it might be hard for you to read the [HTML (HyperText Markup Language)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) that was returned in this response, but your web browser knows just how to turn that into a familiar-looking web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with this simple example, the Requests module has done a whole lot of work for us! We didn't have to write any code to find the web server, make a network connection, construct an HTTP message, wait for a response, or decode the response. Not that HTML can't be messy enough on its own, but let's look at the first bytes of the [raw](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response.raw) message that we received from the server:  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response = requests.get('https://www.google.com', stream=True)\n",
    ">>> print(response.raw.read()[:100])\n",
    "b'\\x1f\\x8b\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\xff\\xc5Z\\xdbz\\x9b\\xc8\\x96\\xbe\\xcfS`\\xf2\\xb5-\\xc6X\\x02$t\\xc28\\xe3v\\xdc\\xdd\\xee\\xce\\xa9\\xb7\\xdd;\\xe9\\x9d\\xce\\xf6W@\\t\\x88\\x11`@>D\\xd6\\x9b\\xce\\xe5<\\xc3\\\\\\xcd\\xc5\\xfc\\xab8\\x08\\xc9Nz\\x1f.&\\x8e1U\\xb5j\\xd5:\\xfc\\xb5jU\\x15\\x87;^\\xe2\\x16\\xf7)\\x97\\x82b\\x1e\\x1d\\x1d\\xd2S'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "What's all that? The response was compressed with [gzip](https://www.gzip.org/), so it had to be decompressed before we could even read the text of the HTML. One more thing that the Requests library handled for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "The requests.Response object also contains the exact request that was created for us. We can check out the headers stored in our object to see that the Requests module told the web server that it was okay to compress the content:  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.request.headers['Accept-Encoding']\n",
    "'gzip, deflate'\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then the server told us that the content had actually been compressed.  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.headers['Content-Encoding']\n",
    "'gzip'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And all this happened by default, without us having to do anything special to make it work. Amazing, right?  \n",

    "## Useful Operations for Python Requests\n",
    "There's a ton of things that we can do with Python Requests.  We'll cover some of the most important features here and give you pointers for more information at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, how do we know if a request we made got a successful response? You can check out the value of `Response.ok`, which will be True if the response was good, and False if it wasn't. \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.ok\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, keep in mind that this will only tell you if the web server says that the response successfully fulfilled the request. The response module can’t determine if that data that you got back is the kind of data that you were expecting. You'll need to do your own checking for that!\n",
    "\n",
    "If the boolean isn’t specific enough for your needs, you can get the [HTTP response code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) that was returned by looking at [Response.status_code](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response.ok):  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.status_code\n",
    "200\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Excellent! To write maintainable, stable code, you’ll always want to check your responses to make sure they succeeded before trying to process them further. For example, you could do something like this:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "if not response.ok:\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"GET failed with status code {}\".format(response.status_code))\n",
    "```\n",
    "But you don't really need to do that. Requests has us covered here, too! We can use the [Response.raise_for_status()](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response.raise_for_status) method, which will raise an HTTPError exception only if the response wasn’t successful.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "response.raise_for_status()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Up next, we'll look into the different types of HTTP request methods that we can make using this handy requests module.  "

    "## HTTP GET and POST Methods\n",
    "HTTP supports several [HTTP methods](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3), like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We're going to spend time on the two most common HTTP requests: GET and POST.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HTTP GET method](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1), of course, retrieves or gets the resource specified in the URL. By sending a GET request to the web server, you’re asking for the server to GET the resource for you. When you’re browsing the web, most of what you’re doing is using your web browser to issue a whole bunch of GET requests for the text, images, videos, and so forth that your browser will display to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GET request can have parameters. Have you ever seen a URL that looked like this?  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://example.com/path/to/api/cat_pictures?search=grey+kitten&max_results=15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The question mark separates the URL resource from the resource's parameters. These parameters are one or more key-value pairs, formatted as a query string. In the example above, the search parameter is set to \"grey+kitten\", and the max_results parameter is set to 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you don't have to write your own code to create an URL like that one. With requests.get(), you can provide a dictionary of parameters, and the Requests module will construct the correct URL for you!  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> p = {\"search\": \"grey kitten\",\n",
    "...      \"max_results\": 15}\n",
    ">>> response = requests.get(\"https://example.com/path/to/api\", params=p)\n",
    ">>> response.request.url\n",
    "'https://example.com/path/to/api?search=grey+kitten&max_results=15'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that using parameters in Requests is yet another form of data serialization. Query strings are handy when we want to send small bits of information, but as our data becomes more complex, it can get hard to represent it using query strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative in that case is using the HTTP POST method. This method sends, or posts, data to a web service. Whenever you fill a web form and press a button to submit, you're using the POST method to send that data back to the web server. This method tends to be used when there's a bunch of data to transmit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scripts, a POST request looks very similar to a GET request. Instead of setting the params attribute, which gets turned into a query string and appended to the URL, we use the data attribute, which contains the data that will be sent as part of the POST request.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> p = {\"description\": \"white kitten\",\n",
    "...      \"name\": \"Snowball\",\n",
    "...      \"age_months\": 6}\n",
    ">>> response = requests.post(\"https://example.com/path/to/api\", data=p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's check out the generated URL for this request:  \n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.request.url\n",
    "'https://example.com/path/to/api'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See how much simpler the URL is on this POST now? Where did all of the parameters go? They’re part of the body of the HTTP message. We can see them by checking out the body attribute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response.request.body\n",
    "'description=white+kitten&name=Snowball&age_months=6'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, ha! There they are!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we need to send and receive data from a web service, we can turn our data into dictionaries and then pass that as the data attribute of a POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, it's super common to send and receive data specifically in JSON format, so the Requests module can do the conversion directly for us, using the json parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> response = requests.post(\"https://example.com/path/to/api\", json=p)\n",
    ">>> response.request.url\n",
    "'https://example.com/path/to/api'\n",
    ">>> response.request.body\n",
    "b'{\"description\": \"white kitten\", \"name\": \"Snowball\", \"age_months\": 6}' \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it for our brief introduction to the Requests module. If you want to learn more, feel free to work through the [Requests Quickstart](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project at the end of this module, you’ll use the Requests module to interact with a web application. This simple application was created using the Django web framework. So, what's that, exactly? Read on to learn more!"
