    "## Data Serialization\n",
    "If you have two programs that need to communicate with each other, how do you get that data from one place to another? We're going to talk about two aspects of that problem: what to send, and how to send it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what do you send? When you have a conversation with another person, you don't send thoughts and memories directly between your brains. At least not yet! You first have to convert your thoughts into language, and then transmit that language to another person. They take that language, and convert it back into thoughts. It’s the same with programs running in different places, or at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous course, we took a list of lists in memory and wrote it to disk as a `Comma-Separated Value (CSV)` file. This is one example of a technique called `data serialization`. Data serialization is the process of taking an in-memory data structure, like a Python object, and turning it into something that can be stored on disk or transmitted across a network. Later, the file can be read, or the network transmission can be received by another program and turned back into an object again. Turning the serialized object back into an in-memory object is called `deserialization`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data serialization is extremely useful for communicating with web services. A web service's API endpoint takes messages in a specific format, containing specific data. By the end of this module, we'll be sending messages to web services, but for now let's concentrate on how to serialize Python objects into some common formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the contact information from one of our CSV examples. We'll keep just two entries to keep our examples short, but there's no limit to how long these can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name,username,phone,department,role\n",
    "Sabrina Green,sgreen,802-867-5309,IT Infrastructure,System Administrator\n",
    "Eli Jones,ejones,684-3481127,IT Infrastructure,IT specialist\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of having a list of lists, we could turn this information into a list of dictionaries. In each of these dictionaries, the key will be the name of the column, and the value will be the corresponding information in each row.  It could look something like this:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "people = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Sabrina Green\",\n",
    "        \"username\": \"sgreen\",\n",
    "        \"phone\": \"802-867-5309\",\n",
    "        \"department\": \"IT Infrastructure\",\n",
    "        \"role\": \"Systems Administrator\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Eli Jones\",\n",
    "        \"username\": \"ejones\",\n",

    "        \"role\": \"IT Specialist\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using a structure like this lets us do interesting things with our information that’s much harder to do with CSV files. For example, let's say we want to record more than one phone number for each person. Instead of using a single string for \"phone\", we could represent that data in another dictionary, like this:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "people = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Sabrina Green\",\n",
    "        \"username\": \"sgreen\",\n",
    "        \"phone\": {\n",
    "            \"office\": \"802-867-5309\",\n",
    "            \"cell\": \"802-867-5310\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        \"department\": \"IT Infrastructure\",\n",
    "        \"role\": \"Systems Administrator\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"Eli Jones\",\n",
    "        \"username\": \"ejones\",\n",

    "        \"role\": \"IT Specialist\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we can record multiple phone numbers per person, and give them descriptive names like \"office\" and \"cell\". This would be hard to store in a CSV file, because the data is not flat. To help us with that, there's a bunch of different formats that we can use to store our data when the structure isn't flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up next, we'll look into a few of the most common ones."

    "## Data Serialization Formats\n",
    "There are lots and lots of ways to serialize data. In this course, we'll cover a couple of the most common ones and we'll look into how you can use them from Python. Once you get the hang of how this works, it's super easy to use a different format if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is the serialization format that we'll use the most in this course. We'll go into some details later but, for now, let's just use the json module to convert our people list of dictionaries into JSON format.  \n",

    "```\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('people.json', 'w') as people_json:\n",
    "    json.dump(people, people_json, indent=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code uses the `json.dump()` function to serialize the people object into a JSON file. The contents of the file will look something like this: \n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Sabrina Green\",\n",
    "    \"username\": \"sgreen\",\n",

    "    \"role\": \"IT Specialist\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)](https://yaml.org/) has a lot in common with JSON. They’re both formats that can be easily understood by a human when looking at the contents. In this example, we’re using the `yaml.safe_dump()` method to serialize our object into YAML:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "import yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('people.yaml', 'w') as people_yaml:\n",
    "    yaml.safe_dump(people, people_yaml)\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "- department: IT Infrastructure\n",
    "  name: Sabrina Green\n",
    "  phone:\n",
    "    cell: 802-867-5310\n",
    "    office: 802-867-5309\n",

    "  name: Eli Jones\n",
    "  phone:\n",
    "    office: 684-348-1127\n",
    "  role: IT Specialist\n",
    "  username: ejones\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this doesn't look exactly like the JSON example above, both formats list the names of the fields as part of the format, so that both the programs parsing the data and the humans looking at it can make sense out of it. The main difference is how these formats are used. JSON is used frequently for transmitting data between web services, while YAML is used the most for storing configuration values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a couple of the most common data serialization formats. We've left out some other pretty common ones like [Python pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), or the [eXtensible Markup Language (XML)](https://www.w3.org/XML/). Each of them is useful in a specific context, although not the focus of this course. You can read more about them by following those links.  "

    "## More About JSON\n",
    "Alright, we've seen a couple of different serialization formats. Let's now dive into more details about [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), which you'll be using in the lab at the end of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned before, JSON is `human-readable`, which means it’s encoded using printable characters, and formatted in a way that a human can understand. This doesn't necessarily mean that you will understand it when you look at it, but you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of web services send messages back and forth using JSON. In this module, and in future ones, you’ll serialize JSON messages to send to a web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON supports a few elements of different data types. These are very basic data types; they represent the most common basic data types supported by any programming language that you might use.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Sabrina Green\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "It also has numbers, which are not.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "1002\n",
    "```\n",
    "JSON has objects, which are key-value pair structures like Python dictionaries.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Sabrina Green\",\n",
    "  \"username\": \"sgreen\",\n",
    "  \"uid\": 1002\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "And a key-value pair can contain another object as a value.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "JSON has arrays, which are equivalent to Python lists. Arrays can contain strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "  \"apple\",\n",
    "  \"banana\",\n",
    "  12345,\n",

    "And as you’ve probably noticed, JSON elements are always comma-delimited. With these basics under your belt, you could create valid JSON by hand, and edit examples of JSON that you encounter.
