    "## A Note on Syntax and Code Blocks\n",
    "When writing code, using correct syntax is super important. Even a small typo, like a missing parentheses or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. Yikes. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Remember that syntax is the rules of how code is constructed, while semantics are the overall effect the code has. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed a syntax error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to submit it to have your work checked."

    "**Using Python on your own**\n",
    "The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.\n",
