    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: `==` \n",
    "\n",
    "- To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: `!=` \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using `>` and `<`. If you try to compare data types that aren’t compatible, like checking if a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator, if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true. Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False.\n"

    "## else Statements and the Modulo Operator\n",
    "We just covered the if statement, which executes code if an evaluation is true and skips the code if it’s false. But what if we wanted the code to do something different if the evaluation is false? We can do this using the else statement. The else statement follows an if block, and is composed of the keyword else followed by a colon. The body of the else statement is indented to the right, and will be executed if the above if statement doesn’t execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also touched on the modulo operator, which is represented by the percent sign: %. This operator performs integer division, but only returns the remainder of this division operation. If we’re dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. Two 2s can go into 5, leaving 1 left over. So 5%2 would return 1. Dividing 10 by 5 would give us a quotient of 2 with no remainder, since 5 can go into 10 twice with nothing left over. In this case, 10%2 would return 0, as there is no remainder."

    "## More Complex Branching with elif Statements\n",
    "Building off of the if and else blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the elif statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the if statements, an elif statement starts with the elif keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An elif statement must follow an if statement, and will only be evaluated if the if statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple elif statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!"
